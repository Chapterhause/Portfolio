#Game 

The basic idea of designing a game is to make mechanics, where the player interacts with a game's environment or each other in a certain way, that encourages a specific experience/state of decision making, that can produce an experience in the player. That last one is where games become an art, that can give their players new ideas and embodied experiences.
