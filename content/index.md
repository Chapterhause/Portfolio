Welcome to my website! These are markdown files, written in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) and displayed with [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz) on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com).

I'm a junior in high school, who experiments with art and technology in my free time. Specifically, I use [NixOS](https://nixos.org) (a distribution of Linux) as a daily driver, write short stories, and make some basic 3d Art with [Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/).

Here are my stories, dot files, and creations:

# Writing

- [[Nepenthe]]

- [[Eclipse]]

- [[Slats]]


# Configurations

[NixOS Home Manager dots](https://github.com/Chapterhause/homeManager)


# Renders

Not actually mine, just a test to see if image linking works
