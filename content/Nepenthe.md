My sight began when the water swirled around me, casting the sky in emerald and gold. While it surged and boiled against all others, I received only a cool, gentle touch. The current’s echoes spoke of the uneven, rocky terrain against which it supported me. Even all the way back when my sight began, I could feel a dull heat held back beyond the waves. This piercing eye of fire stared back at me, stared at my universe, and slowly erased its harmony. A dry wind made its home here, sucking particles from the ground, the soothing balm of the water dried, but it all somehow left me behind. Where did that organ go, the colossal, salty one that soothed my pain and dazzled my eyes with gems?

I thought that I was a light creature, flexible and responsive to the currents around my body, with a soft liquid skin. But all I could feel after the depths dropped away was a tender thing, collapsing and setting into a cast of bone. Was that thing me? The faceted light which had scattered down now focused into one point. It prodded me with ephemeral fingers, coaxing me into a vise of heat. I could see a vague blue haze, but it was only a facsimile of the water, voided and with thin, insipid currents. There was no gravity then, just the hug of drying rock and prickling heat which kept me bound from weightlessness. 

To think this was the order of the world. The thick, weightless cloak of ocean had been lifted from my vision, evaporating into choking hot air and a barren void. Now both the truth and the illusion seemed wrong. As I listened to that thought ring in my mind, I could sense a shadow pass overhead. A dark creature hovered above the rocky plane, searching for something. It seemed to be held aloft by two outstretched limbs, which shivered in response to the drafts of air. I hoped it would speak to me, assure me that the floods would not desert me forever, that the cool hands would scrape along the shore again. Surely, this was a being of a higher form of existence, who could gaze out across the sky and divine grand schemes. Yet it only gave short, halting chirps to me. 

After circling the rocky plane for some time, it alighted on the ground next to me, and stood still, watching. I apologized to it: 

I am sorry if you were expecting to meet a lifeform that could move under its own power. I seemed to be rooted to this rock, but if you could perhaps call the water back here, or tell me of when it will rise again, I will be joyful and forever indebted to you. 

The shadowed creature remained stoic, gave no indication of whether it heard me. Then, it seemed to rise from its trance and approach, nearly grazing one of my splayed limbs. A small scale of cloth got so close that it whispered to my bony skin. 

Please, I said: speak to me. You are the answer, the only being that can see all. I know nothing. I promise that whatever you utter, I will hold onto it as my truth. Surely the fires of the air are but a test, the waters but a hint of what is waiting for me on the other side?

An answer did descend. It was like the rays of light that beat down on me, only it was solid, immovable, revealing my spirit to the world. It probed within my heart, feeling for something, then it seized that element. I felt my body lifting towards the sky, only to fall back against the sediment. The creature left me, racing to a high, cool place beyond the dry shores and fiery air. I know that a piece of me went with it, yet I feel numb. As a kind of moisture soaks the ground, a symbol of my inner strength come out to comfort me, I am tinged with a kind of relief. I will not have to lie on this shore forever.
