The sun sat cold and dark in a cloudless sky. A ring of white light was smeared across the black star. On the horizon, the air turned pale and warm as if dawn was coming. All this passed coolly and mechanically, merely because of one object racing in a circle around another. 

A peasant lived in a village ravaged by plague. Walking to the well for water, he saw rolling black clouds part, and a dark orb descending on the land. “This is the final punishment for our sins. Now the last light of the land will be snuffed out, and the blight shall redouble its strength. All of us here are doomed.”

As the shaman finished her rite by sprinkling the ground with an elixir, blessing the orchard for a better harvest of figs, her magic accidentally leaked upwards. She knew that the gaping hole above her where the sun once sat was her doing, and she felt both elation at her power and guilt. Soon, she rescinded the spell, and the blazing ball of fire returned to the sky. 

A scholar, having invested many sleepless nights into tracking the patterns of the stars, rushed out of his villa to see the wonder of the moon passing before the sun. What greeted him, however, was disappointing. The day turned into night, but it inspired no great sense of wonder, no recognition of the spectacle of nature. It was merely a mechanical motion, the synchronization of orbits. Was this all an eclipse was? He returned to his study before the totality was even finished.

A hunter who was tracking a herd of mammoth across the plain stopped and gazed upwards at a strange ring. It shone with the glimmer of a mica pot, and cast the sky in a shade of obsidian, such that she could only stand there, awed. Only, once it passed, she felt sadness knowing it would probably never appear again, and none of her family, still sleeping at camp, would believe his story.

The leader of his merchant caravan waited for the oxen to finish resting, anxious to arrive at the market soon. Too much longer, and his barely would be worth nothing in Uruk. The midday sun danced in the blistering heat of the desert. Seeing his worried face, it winked at the merchant, providing cool respite for a blissful minute. “A sign! Higher powers work in our favor! Our journey will be lucrative after all!”

A schoolmaster looked across an empty classroom. All this wasted lesson time, just to wait for a little dark spot to appear for a few moments. The children are fortunate these eclipses don’t come all the time, or they would never learn anything! Once they become productive parts in the machinery of our great nation, they will have no time for such distraction.  

Today, the city’s slums were covered by a thicker layer of smoke than usual. The air was the color of a dirty pond, and everyone sealed up their rooms with tarps and rags to lessen the acrid smell. Strangely, the gaps where sunlight poked through all seemed to dim at once, and a fear passed over the tenants that the smog had finally snuffed out the sun itself. Only when the weak light returned did it pass from their hearts.

Millions of years after the Central Referendum had voted to abandon Earth to preserve its remaining species, a small team of archeologists returned to survey the fauna which had evolved on its new supercontinent. They were lucky to arrive when they did, because the last solar eclipse, before the moon drifted too far from its planet to ever block out the sun, appeared before them. They looked on with joy and melancholy at the shadow that inspired so many emotions in its witnesses, some of faith, some of terror, some of curiosity. In the end, it was the third that had won out, but the dark orb didn’t care. It only passed as quickly as it came, and the world was bathed in light.
